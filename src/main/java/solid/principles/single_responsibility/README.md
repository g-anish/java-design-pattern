# Why SOLID principle?

**SOLID principles are important in Java because they help developers create software that is modular, easy to understand, debug,  and refactor. 
By following SOLID principles, developers can create software that is scalable, understandable, maintainable, reusable, testable and long-lasting.**

SOLID principles reduce dependencies so that a block of code can be changed without affecting other code blocks. 
SOLID principles prevent code from becoming rigid and fragile, which helps build long-lasting software.

In Java, SOLID principles are widely used to structure software design. 
By following SOLID principles, developers can save time and effort in both development and maintenance.

SOLID represents five different design principles, these principles are 
1. Single responsibility, principle 
2. Open closed principle 
3. Liskov substitution principle
4. Interface segregation
5. Dependency inversion principle
